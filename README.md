# TODO-list-app

Main idea of TODO list was to do an intuitional TODO list where user could write daily tasks user has to do.
What is done:
- can add task to your list
- can remove task by clicking on it
- text is removed from input field after clicking on button
- added that you can press enter and it will add new task
- store data in localStorage
- add types of tasks (done, in progress, not started)
- can update task status

What could be done:
- sort tasks by type
- task search
