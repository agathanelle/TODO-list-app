# TODO-list-app

Main idea of TODO list was to do an intuitional TODO list where user could write daily tasks he has to do. There should be filter to sort done, uncomplited and both of it tasks. And if task is done, there should be hover on task that with the click you could mask as completed. Also there is X button to remove unwanted button. What is more is to have JSON file to be updated with browserify-fs, but sadly it didn't work as intended.
